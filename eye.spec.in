%description
In EyE, a neural network connected to pixels of a moving window (retina)
from one or several input image(s) is trained to associate these "stimuli" to
the corresponding response in one or several output (model) image(s).
The resulting filter can then be loaded in SExtractor to operate complex,
wildly non-linear filters on astronomical images. Typical applications of EyE
include adaptive filtering, feature detection and cosmetic corrections.
