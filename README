Eye stands for ``Enhance your Extraction'': a software for training
SExtractor's retina. The retina expands the possibility offered by traditional
convolution (e.g. matched filtering) to the non-linear domain.

A neural network, connected to pixels of a moving window (``retina'') in one
or  several input image(s), is trained to associate
these ``stimuli'' to the corresponding response in one or several ``model''
image(s). The resulting filter can then be loaded in SExtractor to operate
complex, wildly non-linear filters on astronomical images. Typical
applications of this system include adaptive filtering, feature detection and
cosmetic corrections.

This file describes shortly the SYNTAX of EyE.
See INSTALL for instructions about install.
For more information, please refer to the documentation
(see http://terapix.iap.fr/soft/eye/ )

The general SYNTAX is the following:
% eye -i Input_image1 [Input_image2 ...] -o Output_image1 [Output_image2 ...]
      [-c configuration-file] [-Parameter1  Value1 [-Parameter2  Value2 ...]]

- Keyword parameters given in the command line override those from the
  configuration file.
- If the list-file is given as unique argument, EyE looks for a
  default configuration file called ``default.eye''. If no configuration
  file is available, EyE uses internal defaults.

% eye -d

prints a default configuration file on the standard output
