.SH DESCRIPTION
A neural network, connected to pixels of a moving window (``retina'') in one
or  several input image(s), is trained to associate these ``stimuli'' to the
corresponding response in one or several output (``model'') image(s).
The resulting filter can then be loaded in SExtractor to operate complex,
wildly non-linear filters on astronomical images. Typical applications of this
system include adaptive filtering, feature detection and cosmetic corrections.
